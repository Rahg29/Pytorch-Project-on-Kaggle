Step by Step procedures to build the Image Classification model on Kaggle

1. Select dataset of your choice and upload on Kaggle
2. Apply augmentation to the original dataset
3. Visualize the augmented dataset
4. Configure GPU
5. Build the model and start training
6. Analyse the modelâ€™s accuracy and loss

To understand all the above steps in more details, please read my blog hosted on jovian.ai that demonstrate how to leverage capabilities of Kaggle platform.
